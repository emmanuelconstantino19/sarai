			<h2 style="font-family:'Rosarivo'">Introduction</h2>
	
	<p>

	With the passage of the Climate Change Act of 2009 (Republic Act No. 9729) and the Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010 (Republic Act No. 10121), the Philippine government has made significant progress towards mainstreaming climate change adaptation and mitigation, and disaster preparedness and response strategies into the development, planning, budgeting, and communication processes. The mainstreaming activities are made possible through research, teaching and public services between and among the national agencies, local government units, higher education institutions, privates sectors, and civil society organizations.

	</p>

	<p>
	
	The 2015 Philippines Millennium Development Goals (MDG) Progress Report indicates improvement in promoting gender equality, reducing child mortality and malaria. However, it also points out that our overall MDG accomplishments are not encouraging. This is reflected in our low achievements on goals in conditions related to poverty, education, maternal health, HIV/AIDS, and the environment. As part of the global road towards realizing the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), we are all committed to responsibly engage and unite to end hunger and poverty, fight inequality and injustice, and protect our people and the planet Earth.
 	
 	</p>

 	<p>

	Our country’s location in the Pacific Ring of Fire makes our small island communities, coastal villages, and less privileged people extremely vulnerable to various hazards. These includes typhoons, storm surges, sea level rise, earthquakes, and volcanic hazards, among others. Man-made disasters such as the long-running armed conflict and insurgency in Mindanao, further hinders the success of sustainable development efforts and economic prosperity in the country.

	</p>

	<p>
 
	Our government has succeeded in positioning important and cross-cutting policy frameworks and plans to direct, pursue and accelerate the achievement of SDGs in line with our vision to build adaptive communities and resilient ecosystems towards sustainable and inclusive development. These plans are embedded in our National Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP) 2011-2028 and in the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Plan (NDRRMP) 2011-2028.

	</p>

	<p>
 
	The NCCAP 2011-2028 is a plan that translates the national climate change framework strategy. This plan prioritizes food security, water sufficiency, ecological and environmental stability, human security, climate-smart industries and services, sustainable energy and knowledge and capacity development as the strategic direction for 2011 to 2028. It assesses the current situation of the country with regard to climate change risks and outlines the strategic direction for 2011 to 2028 as a response to the current situation and projected impacts.

	</p>

	<p>
 
	On the other hand, the NDRRMP 2011-2028 is consistent with the national disaster risk reduction and management framework that envisions a country of “safer, adaptive and disaster-resilient Filipino communities toward sustainable development”. It conveys a paradigm shift from reactive to proactive DRRM that translates to increased resilience and reduced vulnerabilities.  

	</p>

	<p>
	
Notably, food security and human security are the essential elements that make up the NCCAP 2011-2028 and the NDRRMP 2011-2028, with regard to Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) and DRRM, respectively. Only by looking into the cost-benefit interactions between agriculture, environment, and communities can we truly formulate actions that would result into a resilient and sustainable Philippines. 
 	</p>

 	<p>
	Project SARAI (Smarter Approaches to Reinvigorate Agriculture as an Industry in the Philippines) is a move towards these objectives. The program presented an opportunity for scientists, researchers, and extension workers to collaborate with local government units and farming communities. These collaborations help build relationships that stimulated discussion and identified avenues for bridging gaps between farmer needs and technological development. It is dedicated to generate and transfer knowledge and technologies to form an army of tech-savvy agricultural officers, technicians, and farmers. By training these groups to become confident in their use of knowledge on weather, climate, crop, soil, water, nutrient, pests and diseases, and impacts of climate change, the country now has a better chance at improving its rice productivity and profitability, thus, addressing SDG targets on food security and climate action.  
 	</p>

 	<p>
The <strong>SARAI TRAINING TOOLKIT FOR RICE</strong> is a user-friendly guide to all the developed technologies and systems of the program. It provides the stakeholders a holistic view of the program, and its direct applications to daily agricultural practices. In addition to the conduct of lectures and group discussions, one other important facet of the SARAI Training is the incorporation of fieldworks to the exercises. These field exposures provide participants the opportunities to test out what they learned, document their questions, and directly discuss with the trainers issues that can only be better appreciated in a field setting.
	</p>

	<p>
 
The toolkit is a package of modules, powerpoint presentations, and handouts. All these materials will be provided to the training participants, both in hardcopy and e-copy formats. 

	</p>

	<p>
<strong>VOLUME 1: Introduction to SARAI</strong><br/>
This volume discusses the detailed introduction to the program – its main objectives, various components, and expected outputs. This is an appreciation volume that presents ideas for how SARAI can contribute to the regular agricultural activities of our farmers. It is divided into two modules:
	</p>
	<p style="margin-left:15px">
		Module 1 – Detailed discussion on Project SARAI and its various components<br/>
		Module 2 – Introduction and discussion on the smarter technologies promoted by 	Project SARAI
	</p>

	<p>
 
<strong>VOLUME 2: Climate, Weather, and Climate Change</strong><br/>
Before the trainers introduce the participants to numerous technologies and systems to improve their agricultural practices, it is important for them to develop a basic understanding of climate, weather, and climate change. This volume has two modules:

	</p>

	<p style="margin-left:15px">
 
	Module 1 – Discussion on climate and weather<br/>
	Module 2 – Understanding climate change, climate variability, and extreme weather events
	</p>
 	<p>

<strong>VOLUME 3: Pest and Diseases</strong><br/>
This volume focuses on the major rice pests and diseases. Similarly, two modules comprise this volume:
</p>
<p style="margin-left:15px">
Module 1 - Provides detailed discussions and illustrations for 	pest identification and their corresponding control measures.<br/>
Module 2 - Focuses on rice diseases.<br/> 
	Module 3 -  Presents the mobile and web application called 	SARAI Smarter Pest Identification  Technology (SPid Tech).
</p>

<p> 
This volume is a significant improvement from older published materials on rice pests and diseases. It highlights the importance of understanding the plants’ specific growth stage and how their vulnerabilities to particular pests and diseases change over time. Immediate control measures are also presented on a per life-stage format for quicker reference. 
 </p>
 <p>
<strong>VOLUME 4: Nutrient Management</strong><br/>
This volume contains comprehensive discussions on two major topics:
</p>
<p style="margin-left:15px"> 
	Module 1 – Basic crop-nutrient interaction, and the impacts of the various nutrient 	cycles to crop production.<br/>
	Module 2 –Integrated Crop Management (ICM) with focus on Site-Specific Nutrient Management (SSNM)
 </p>
 <p>
This volume emphasizes the importance of providing our farmers with site-specific crop nutrient advisories for maximum crop growth.
</p>
 
 <p>
<strong>VOLUME 5: SARAI Knowledge Portal</strong><br/> 
This volume gives a walkthrough on the SARAI Knowledge Portal. This portal offers a wide-range of agricultural services in web and mobile platforms for its initial six priority crops. It contains only one module:

			<h2 style="font-family:'Rosarivo'">The SARAI Training Process</h2>

			<h5 style="font-family:'Candara'; color:#ed7d31; font-weight: bold">PRE-TRAINING PHASE</h5>

			<p>
				<strong>Training Needs Assessment (TNA)</strong><br/> 
				Prior to the crafting of this training toolkit, Project SARAI conducted training needs assessments (TNA) among randomly sampled farmers nationwide. The team was able to survey a total of 2298 farmers from 19 SARAI sites across the country. 

			</p>

			<p>
				The TNA is a participatory method of determining the knowledge, attitudes, practices, and information gaps of the stakeholders. It provides the research team with the bigger picture of the farming communities in the country and the finer details in each small farming community that highlights specific needs. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Two methodologies for the TNA were employed: 1) researcher-administered survey using pen-and-paper type surveys, and 2) researcher-administered survey using the SARAI-developed mobile application. The survey looked into the following information: demographics ; farm characteristics; common pest and diseases occurrence in their farms; access to communication materials and mass media; knowledge on climate change; ideas on advances in agriculture; forms of agriculture-related assistance received by the communities; and levels of agricultural trainings received or that have been made available to them.
			</p>

			<p>
				The TNA provided the information needed to fill in the gaps between “what is” and “what should be,” specifically in terms of current agricultural knowledge, attitudes, and practices of our farmers. The conduct of the TNA is a way of recognizing that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to agricultural extension. Trainings should be tailor-fitted per stakeholder – as each group has different learning abilities, resources, and training needs.
			</p>

			<p>
				As this toolkit is designed to be used for the training of MAOs, agricultural technicians, and researchers, there is a certain level of administrative preparation that needs to be accomplished prior to the conduct of the trainings. Specific activities needed are as follows:
			</p>

			<p style="margin-bottom:0">
				1. The learning objectives for each module must be made clear to the participants<br/>
				2. A blended form of delivery formats will be utilized
			</p>

			<p style="margin-left:25px;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">
				a. Lecture presentations –a classroom-based instruction for the discussion of the lessons included in the modules<br/>
				b. Demonstration – tutorial of the step-by-step process on how to use the introduced system or technology.<br/>  
				c. Learning exercises – problem solving activities related to the topic being discussed<br/>
				d. Field visits – participants are to be given the opportunity to observe, interact, and use the skills they learned from the lectures. 
			</p>
			<p>
				3. Task identification – the distribution of responsibilities of organizers and participants should be explained clearly.<br/>
				4. Site identification – sites to be visited during the training should be coordinated with the proper authorities prior to the training<br/>
				5. Administrative preparations – this is an important component to any successful training. This refers to the preparation for the venue, program, resource speakers, invitation of the participants, budget, food, accommodation, and logistics.
			</p>

			<p style="font-weight:bold;">
				TRAINING PHASE
			</p>
			<p>
				The following are the necessary preparations that need to be made to ensure that the objectives of the trainings are met:
			</p>

			<p>
				1. Ensure the readiness of the manpower and the training materials<br/>
				2. Introduce the training objectives to the participants and elicit their expectations<br/>
				3. Present the training materials<br/>
				4. Conduct the training exercises<br/>
				5. The activities<br/>
				6. Distribute the survey forms
			</p>

			<p style="font-weight:bold;">
				POST TRAINING PHASE
			</p>

			<p>
				The training scheme is designed to allow the participants to be able to re-echo the same skills and ideas to other groups. Thus, level 1 of training involves selected Municipal Agricultural Officers (MAOs), agricultural technicians, and representatives from academic institutions. These groups are then expected to conduct the same trainings to farmers and other agricultural practitioners in their respective municipalities. They are considered the Level 2 participants.
			</p>

			<p>
				Thus, the post-training phase has two crucial aspects: 1) monitoring and evaluation of the trained Level 1 participants as to their uptake of the ideas, technologies and systems, and 2) monitoring and evaluation of the succeeding trainings that they will conduct with their respective communities. This involves observing and improving on their delivery methods, and monitoring how their participants respond, and if they do in fact subscribe to the recommendations/new skills or systems introduced.
			</p>

			<p>
				This involves monitoring the level 1 participants in terms of conduct of the re-echo training and their use of new skills acquired.
			</p>

			<p>
				For the monitoring and evaluation of the Level 1 participants, the following post-training measures will be employed:
			</p>

			<p>
				Number of technologies adopted in the municipality<br/>
				Number of farmers persuaded to join the SARAI training
			</p>

			<p>
				For the monitoring and evaluation of the succeeding trainings conducted for the Level 2 groups, the following measures will be used:
			</p>

			<p>
				Number of farmers/farming communities who joined the training<br/>
				Number of technologies adopted by the farmers<br/>
				Change in farming perceptions and practices
			</p>

			<p>
				The monitoring and evaluation scheme takes into account that changing perceptions and practices takes more than just trainings. It involves holding a series of field exposures and providing incentives and benefits for adopting to the new technologies.
			</p>

			<p>
				The Project SARAI training process is an evolving system. The initial conduct of trainings and the results of the evaluation per training will serve as benchmark of improvement points and revisions in the modules.

			<h5 style="font-weight:bold">Preface</h5>
			
			<p>Welcome to the SARAI Training Toolkit for Maize Nutrient Expert ®! </p>
			
			<p>Climate change is unequivocal. It is the single most daunting global challenge that humanity has ever faced. In the Philippines, climate change and its impacts in agriculture have to be addressed with strengthening resource use efficiency to ensure food self-sufficiency and livelihood security.</p>

			<p>
			With the country’s rapidly growing population and wavering economic conditions, Filipino farmers are challenged to become smarter to produce more food sustainably, and become more resilient to changes and shocks. This is where Climate-Smart Agriculture comes in. By forging collaborations between experts of diverse scientific disciplines, the action research program “Smarter Approaches to Reinvigorate Agriculture as an Industry in the Philippines (Project SARAI)“ was implemented by the University of the Philippines Los 
			Baños, through funding from the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) - Philippine Council for Agriculture, Aquatic and Natural Resources Research and Development (PCAARRD).
			</p>
			<p>
			 Project SARAI is an interdisciplinary research, development and extension (RDE) program. It makes use of advances and innovations in science, information technology, and technical support systems in building a nationwide framework of practical RDE-based solutions and recommendations for the agricultural sector. Project SARAI focuses on six major crops, namely: rice, corn, banana, coconut, coffee, and cacao. 
			</p>
			<p>
			 A major task of Project SARAI is to make sure that program outputs are translated into useful materials, technologies and practices. As a preparatory work to deliver this objective, survey assessments were conducted in 19 provinces across the country, involving over a thousand farmers, agricultural officers and technicians. One of the many identified capacity-building needs of the different farming communities is the high preference of farmers for hands-on trainings and field exercises. This is the main motivation for the development of the SARAI Training Toolkit.  
			</p>
			<p>
			This training toolkit is intended for use primarily by field-based agricultural technicians, agricultural officers, agricultural development professionals and university researchers for the training on the use of the Maize Nutrient Expert®. The over-all content structure of this toolkit puts greater emphasis on enabling users to easily follow the instructions or tutorials on the use the PC- and Android-based application of Maize Nutrient Expert®.  
			Ultimately, we envision SARAI-trained technicians to be reliable users of technical information, diligent contributors to continued data acquisition, and enthusiastic information disseminators. Through the re-echoing of these technicians, SARAI-generated knowledge can be disseminated much faster and wider to develop an army of farmers who are confident at making science-based farming decisions.  
			</p>
			<p>
			We ask you to link with the Project SARAI movement and join the pack of champions in engendering a climate-smart Philippine agricultural sector for the sake of our future generations.  
			</p>
			<p>
			As you flip through the pages of this training toolkit, switch that learning mode on and keep it going. We hope that with this toolkit you will likewise be inspired to share your unique ideas and make your own contributions to reinvigorate the Philippine agriculture industry.
