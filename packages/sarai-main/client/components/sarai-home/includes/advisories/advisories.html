      <p style="text-align:left">
        <strong>Advisories:</strong><br/><br/>
        1) Earlier harvesting is suggested since rainfall is predicted to reach between
        250-300 mm at the time when rice plants are ready for harvest. Ensure
        availability of drying facilities after harvest.<br/><br/>
        2) Consider use of short-duration rice varieties such as PSB Rc14 (116 DAS,
        maximum yield = 6.1 t ha<sup>-1</sup>), PSB Rc68 (116 DAS; maximum yield = 4.4 t ha<sup>-1</sup> ),
        NSIC Rc9 (119 days; maximum yield = 5.5 t ha<sup>-1</sup> ), and NSIC Rc222 (106 and 114
        DAS; maximum yield = 10 t ha<sup>-1</sup> ).

      <p style="text-align:left"><strong>Fertilization:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul style="text-align:left">
       <li>Incorporate resources that will improve the organic matter of upland soils.</li>
       <li>Best time to apply fertilizers is at early tillering stage and panicle initiation stage.</li>

       <li>Water must be sufficient when fertilizers are applied.</li>
       <li>Do not top dress when leaves are wet, fertilizers might stick on the leaves which will
       cause leaf burns.</li>
