					  <p style="margin-bottom:0">Based on FAO (2016) data the average farm bean yield for both coffee and cacao is
merely around 5000kg ha-1. These is much lower compared to reported yields as high as
2.0-4.6 t ha-1 in well managed farm neighboring countries (Yusof, 2000). Through recent
attempts were made to revive the coffee and cacao industries, both industries are still
challenged by low productivity, pest and disease infestations, declining soil fertility,
availability and high cost of farm input, fluctuating agrometeorological conditions, and
outdated production systems and poor management practices.<br /><br />
The development of effective farm management strategies in tropical perennial
crops like coffee and cacao is through understanding of crop phenology. To optimize
management practices for coffee and cacao, their growth and developmental patterns must
be understood. Crop models are required to perform simulations of climate variability and
change, together with predictions of how coffee and cacao will respond to different climate
variables. This research aimed to provide a thorough characterization of the phenological

development of coffee and cacao from inflorescence emergence to fruit maturity in the
accordance of BBCH scale.</p>

					  <p style="margin-bottom:0">This project will closely work with Project 1.1 as soybean will be planted after corn.
This consists of three study areas focusing on soybean (Glycine max). The first study will
determine the crop genetic coefficients of selected local varieties of soybean using the
existing crop growth simulation model. Using the crop genetic coefficients generated from
the first study, the crop models will be validated using a different experimental data set.
The simulated yield and observed yield will be analyzed statistically. When the crop model
performance reaches the acceptable margin of error, computerbased experiments will be
done to simulate the potential crop yield under a given climate scenario. The crop model
will be applied to determine appropriate crop management strategies for a particular
climatic condition.</p>

					  <p style="margin-bottom:0">SEAMS is the proactive monitoring component of the program. It uses free satellite
images from NASA, European Union, and soon from DIWATA 1. These remotely sensed data
will serve as inputs for analysis such as near real-time crop monitoring, mapping actual
area planted with specific crops, crop damage assessment, and possible breeding grounds
for pest infestations and outbreaks. The analysis provided by SEAMS can be trickled down
up to municipal and barangay levels. This will allow for a more site specific advisory
system that the farmers can really benefit from.<br /><br />
SEAMS, as a project component, cuts across all the identified crops of SARAI Phase 2.
This enables the program to provide a comprehensive and site specific analysis of various
cropping areas. During Project SARAI’s Phase I, SEAMS heavily focused on rice and corn; for
the proposed SARAI Phase 2, the focus and the bulk of activities will be for the other
priority crops.<br /><br />
Onsite Implementers and Collaborators<br /><br />
Project SARAI can only be effective in the regions and municipalities through
strengthening its partnership with State Universities and Colleges (SUCs), DOST regional
offices, Local Government Units (LGUs), and other research institutions. The activities that
will be undertaken by the partners will be monitored and considered under the
supervision of Sub-program 2, specifically under the CL SEAMS component.<br /><br />
SUCs, depending on the available crops in their areas, will be performing assigned
activities, and will be directly reporting to sub-program 2. They will also be performing the
crop monitoring activities specified by CL SEAMS which will serve as rich inputs and
validation data to the remotely-sensed monitoring protocols.</p>

over the country. Each project had their unique system of gathering and storing data. The
output of the processed weather data are provided to the public via different platforms and
web sites. Therefore there is a need to integrate these AWS into a common network and
database.<br /><br />
The project shall continue the maintenance of the existing SARAI Automatic
Weather Stations (AWS) and expand the capabilities of the AWS network by implementing
additional AWS sites to partner agencies in regions with one or no AWS equipment. At
present, the SARAI network consists of 18 AWS that are located at various sites in the
country. To augment these existing AWS, 7 more AWS will be installed in Regions 1, 2, 3,
4A, 8, 13 and CAR.<br /><br />
The SARAI network will be further augmented by including the AWS of projects
under the wing of the Department of Science and Technology - Philippine Council for
Agriculture, Aquatic and Natural Resources Research and Development (DOST-PCAARRD)
in an interconnected system. Through the expanded network of SARAI, the availability of
weather and soil data in remote locations, especially in areas where there is no existing
SARAI AWS, will increase; the collected weather and soil data can be cross-checked against
other AWS which will improve and substantiate data reliability; and the initiative to build
relationships among partner agencies for further research collaborations in the future.<br /><br />
Training on the set up, use and maintenance of the AWS shall be conducted in order
to capacitate partner agency personnel. The project shall also train these personnel on
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flight and Near-infrared Reflectance (NIR) Camera use for
site-specific crop monitoring in their respective regions.<br /><br />
Furthermore, software tools for processing weather data and aerial images shall be
introduced to said personnel for the purpose of data analysis and interpretation.</p>

					  <p style="margin-bottom:0">Agricultural drought is a perennial problem in the Philippines which caused losses
amounting to billions of pesos to both crop producers and consumers. The problem is
expected to become even worse with anticipated anthropogenic global warming. Through
assessment and forecasting of drought occurrences, the project will provide policy makers,
government agencies, farmers and the general public with tools needed to formulate
strategies to meet the impacts of upcoming events. These tools will be in form of maps that
would facilitate evaluation of magnitude and extent of drought risks. This project will also
extend previous research work to operational activities of collaborating agencies (PAGASA
and DA-BSWM) and enhance the drought mitigation capabilities of the country.<br /><br />
Drought and Crop Assessment and Forecasting (DCAF) is an applied science 
research combining the fields of Agriculture, Environmental Science, Hydrology,
Atmospheric Science, and Remote Sensing with the vision of improving the nation’s
capability of predicting drought occurrences, assessing crop yield and mitigating severe
effects of drought in the Philippines. It has two main objectives:
1) develop a method on monitoring drought events and crop production through
combination of satellite and in-situ data; and
2) forecast drought six months ahead using models with satellite data and in-situ data
combined.</p>

					  <p style="margin-bottom:0">The SARAI Project 3-Development of a Knowledge Portal, stationed in the Institute of Computer Science, provides for a knowledge portal-based infrastructure to enable the SARAI program introduce science and technology interventions to farmers, policy makers and agricultural researchers. The portal offers a wide-range of agricultural services in web and mobile platforms for its initial six priority crops. It is anchored on precision agriculture by optimizing the use of advances in technology such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Crop and Simulation Modelling (CSM), Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems (RS/GIS), and field sensors to develop decision support models for crop forecasting, crop advisories, and early warning systems. It provides visual information on suitability, vulnerability, hazard, and crop production areas to help farmers attain maximum production and profit. It can also provide an integrated crop support system which includes site-specific nutrient management, water management, and pest identification to maximize the yield and adaptability of the farmers. Through these services, the traditional practices in farming decisions and strategies can be shifted from react to anticipate by guiding farmers’ action through the provision of online access to decision support systems, with reinforced real-time data.</p>
