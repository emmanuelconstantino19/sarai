				Project 1.1 Using Crop Simulation Models for Issuing Crop Advisories to Farmers<br/>Project Leader: Dr. Felino P. Lansigan, PhD
				</b></p>
				<p>
				SARAI has already developed a crop forecasting protocol for corn based on an
				operational framework using a generic process-based crop forecasting system. The
				protocol is comprised of statistical downscaling of climate forecasts, simulated crop yield,
				crop area estimates, and determining best planting dates for rice. The program generated
				crop coefficients to validate crop simulation models for major corn cultivars grown in the
				country.

				Project 1.2 Phenology Studies, Crop Management, and Model Development for Sugarcane and Coconut<br/>Project Leader: Consorcia E. Reaño, PhD
				</b></p>
				<p>
				The objective of this study is to develop yield models using process-based models
				that have been developed in other countries. Process-based models requires specific
				cultivar parameters which vary from cultivar to cultivar and thus need to be estimated
				under local conditions to raise the quality of calibration in these crop models. Specifically, it
				aims to generate the parameters or genetic coefficients of recommended local cultivars in
				controlled experiments which shall cover a diverse range of planting dates, soil
				characteristics, pest environment and water availability.

				Project 1.3 Phenology Studies, Crop Management and Model Development for Coffee and Cacao <br/>Project Leader: Calixto M. Protacio, PhD
				</b></p>
				<p>
				Based on FAO (2016) data the average farm bean yield for both coffee and cacao is
				merely around 5000kg ha-1. These is much lower compared to reported yields as high as
				2.0-4.6 t ha-1 in well managed farm neighboring countries (Yusof, 2000). Through recent
				attempts were made to revive the coffee and cacao industries, both industries are still
				challenged by low productivity, pest and disease infestations, declining soil fertility,
				availability and high cost of farm input, fluctuating agrometeorological conditions, and
				outdated production systems and poor management practices.
				</p>
				<p>
				The development of effective farm management strategies in tropical perennial
				crops like coffee and cacao is through understanding of crop phenology. To optimize
				management practices for coffee and cacao, their growth and developmental patterns must
				be understood. Crop models are required to perform simulations of climate variability and
				change, together with predictions of how coffee and cacao will respond to different climate
				variables. This research aimed to provide a thorough characterization of the phenological development of coffee and cacao from inflorescence emergence to fruit maturity in the
				accordance of BBCH scale.

				<p>
				The objective of this study is to develop banana yield models using process-based
				models that have been developed in other countries. Process-based models requires
				specific cultivar parameters which vary from cultivar to cultivar and thus need to be
				estimated under local conditions to raise the quality of calibration in these crop models.
				Specifically, it aims to generate the parameters or genetic coefficients of recommended
				local cultivars in controlled experiments which shall cover a diverse range of planting

				Project 1.5 Evaluation of Crop Growth Simulation Models in Developing Crop Yield Forecasting System for Soybean and Vegetables<br/>Project Leader: Hazel Anne F. Makahiya, MSc
				</b></p>
				<p>
				This project will closely work with Project 1.1 as soybean will be planted after corn.
				This consists of three study areas focusing on soybean (Glycine max). The first study will
				determine the crop genetic coefficients of selected local varieties of soybean using the
				existing crop growth simulation model. Using the crop genetic coefficients generated from
				the first study, the crop models will be validated using a different experimental data set.
				The simulated yield and observed yield will be analyzed statistically. When the crop model
				performance reaches the acceptable margin of error, computerbased experiments will be
				done to simulate the potential crop yield under a given climate scenario. The crop model
				will be applied to determine appropriate crop management strategies for a particular
				climatic condition.

				<div style="margin-left:10px">
				<p><b>
				Project 2.1 Community-Level SARAI-Enhanced Agricultural Monitoring System (CL SEAMS)<br/>Project Leader: Engr. Moises A. Dorado
				</b></p>
				<p>
					SEAMS is the proactive monitoring component of the program. It uses free satellite
					images from NASA, European Union, and soon from DIWATA 1. These remotely sensed data
					will serve as inputs for analysis such as near real-time crop monitoring, mapping actual
					area planted with specific crops, crop damage assessment, and possible breeding grounds
					for pest infestations and outbreaks. The analysis provided by SEAMS can be trickled down
					up to municipal and barangay levels. This will allow for a more site specific advisory
					system that the farmers can really benefit from.
					</p>
					<p>
					SEAMS, as a project component, cuts across all the identified crops of SARAI Phase 2.
					This enables the program to provide a comprehensive and site specific analysis of various
					cropping areas. During Project SARAI’s Phase I, SEAMS heavily focused on rice and corn; for
					the proposed SARAI Phase 2, the focus and the bulk of activities will be for the other
					priority crops.
					</p>
					<p>
					Onsite Implementers and Collaborators
					</p>
					<p>
					Project SARAI can only be effective in the regions and municipalities through
					strengthening its partnership with State Universities and Colleges (SUCs), DOST regional
					offices, Local Government Units (LGUs), and other research institutions. The activities that
					will be undertaken by the partners will be monitored and considered under the
					supervision of Sub-program 2, specifically under the CL SEAMS component.
					</p>
					<p>
					SUCs, depending on the available crops in their areas, will be performing assigned
					activities, and will be directly reporting to sub-program 2. They will also be performing the
					crop monitoring activities specified by CL SEAMS which will serve as rich inputs and
					validation data to the remotely-sensed monitoring protocols.

				Project 2.2 Maintenance and Enhanced Connectivity of Existing AWS units under PCAARRD<br/>Project Leader: Prof. Nelio C. Altoveros
				</b></p>

				<p>
				There are various automatic weather stations installed by PCAARRD projects all
				over the country. Each project had their unique system of gathering and storing data. The
				output of the processed weather data are provided to the public via different platforms and
				web sites. Therefore there is a need to integrate these AWS into a common network and
				database.
				</p>
				<p>
				The project shall continue the maintenance of the existing SARAI Automatic
				Weather Stations (AWS) and expand the capabilities of the AWS network by implementing
				additional AWS sites to partner agencies in regions with one or no AWS equipment. At
				present, the SARAI network consists of 18 AWS that are located at various sites in the
				country. To augment these existing AWS, 7 more AWS will be installed in Regions 1, 2, 3,
				4A, 8, 13 and CAR.
				</p>
				<p>
				The SARAI network will be further augmented by including the AWS of projects
				under the wing of the Department of Science and Technology - Philippine Council for
				Agriculture, Aquatic and Natural Resources Research and Development (DOST-PCAARRD)
				in an interconnected system. Through the expanded network of SARAI, the availability of
				weather and soil data in remote locations, especially in areas where there is no existing
				SARAI AWS, will increase; the collected weather and soil data can be cross-checked against
				other AWS which will improve and substantiate data reliability; and the initiative to build
				relationships among partner agencies for further research collaborations in the future.
				</p>
				<p>
				Training on the set up, use and maintenance of the AWS shall be conducted in order
				to capacitate partner agency personnel. The project shall also train these personnel on
				Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flight and Near-infrared Reflectance (NIR) Camera use for
				site-specific crop monitoring in their respective regions.
				</p>
				<p>
				Furthermore, software tools for processing weather data and aerial images shall be
				introduced to said personnel for the purpose of data analysis and interpretation.

				Project 2.3. Smart Technologies for Crop Water Management<br/>Project Leader: Roger A. Luyun, PhD
				</b></p>
				<p>
				During Project SARAI phase I, the water management component provided
				opportunities for technology fabrication, and development of a decision support system
				(DSS) for water management protocols. For the proposed Phase 2, the water management
				component will improve the design and fabricate low-cost soil moisture meters and
				sensors, and will deploy the units to more partner institutions for more intensive validation
				and calibration measures. On top of that, the water management component will also cover
				all the identified crops for SARAI Phase 2. There will also be cropping areas monitoring,
				and model development for an early warning system for drought and crop stress. The
				water management DSS will also be uploaded in the SARAI knowledge portal, so that
				various stakeholders can have access to the information.

				Project 2.4 Insect Pest and Disease Advisory System (IPDAS)<br/>Project Leader: Melvin D. Ebuenga, PhD
				</b></p>
				<p>
				The crop protection component will cover all the major pests and diseases for all the
				identified crops. Its major outputs include a detailed database of common pests and
				diseases for the crops in various regions; region-specific maps of possible pest and disease
				outbreak areas for certain crops; and pest management protocols. The crop protection
				aims to make these outputs available for all the identified crops of SARAI Phase 2. The team
				will work with the computer science group to refine the design and operation of SPId Tech.

				Project 2.5 Soil Profiling and Characterization<br/>Project Leader: Prof. Victorino A. Bato
				</b></p>
				<p>
				Soil sampling and profiling will be performed on the study sites. Soil samples will be
				sent to the laboratory for physical, chemical, and mineralogical analyses. The results
				obtained from the lab will be the baseline data that researchers will utilize for their
				fertilizer application and water and crop management. The same lab results will be utilized
				as baseline data by crop modelers for their crop model development. During the growth
				period of the crop, soil samples will be taken and analyzed as necessary or as requested by
				the researchers. Soil moisture sensors will be imbedded at different soil horizons and the
				changes in soils moisture will be continuously monitored. The data obtained from 19 this
				monitoring will be forwarded to other researchers who need them for irrigation
				management or for crop modelling.

				Project 2.6 Drought and Crop Assessment and Forecasting (DCAF) Phase 2<br/>Project Leader: Gay Jane P. Perez, PhD
				</b></p>
				<p>
				Agricultural drought is a perennial problem in the Philippines which caused losses
				amounting to billions of pesos to both crop producers and consumers. The problem is
				expected to become even worse with anticipated anthropogenic global warming. Through
				assessment and forecasting of drought occurrences, the project will provide policy makers,
				government agencies, farmers and the general public with tools needed to formulate
				strategies to meet the impacts of upcoming events. These tools will be in form of maps that
				would facilitate evaluation of magnitude and extent of drought risks. This project will also
				extend previous research work to operational activities of collaborating agencies (PAGASA
				and DA-BSWM) and enhance the drought mitigation capabilities of the country.
				</p>
				<p>
				Drought and Crop Assessment and Forecasting (DCAF) is an applied science
				research combining the fields of Agriculture, Environmental Science, Hydrology,
				Atmospheric Science, and Remote Sensing with the vision of improving the nation’s
				capability of predicting drought occurrences, assessing crop yield and mitigating severe
				effects of drought in the Philippines. It has two main objectives:
				1) develop a method on monitoring drought events and crop production through
				combination of satellite and in-situ data; and
				2) forecast drought six months ahead using models with satellite data and in-situ data
				combined.

				<p>
				In order to generate high quality and reliable results, the ASI Soil Science Laboratory
				needs to upgrade its existing facilities. New equipment such as those listed in DOST Form
				2-B need to be acquired to carry out the required characterization and soil profiling of the
				various study areas. The procurement of these new equipment will have a very high impact
				not only on Project SARAI Phase 2 but also on other projects funded by PCAARRD/DOST

				Project 3.1 Knowledge Management and Mobile Applications for Agriculture<br/>Project Leader: Prof. Concepcion L. Khan
				</b></p>
				<p>
				The project is proposed to cover the following: a) enhance the SARAI knowledge
				portal by sustaining the real-time monitoring of weather data, and continuous
				development of decision support systems to include additional cereals, fruits, vegetables,
				root crops and other high-value crops; b) develop a knowledge management system to
				provide an online platform for agriculture stakeholders; and c) use the computing power of
				mobile technology to develop a variety of practical applications targeting farmers and farm
				managers as end-users.
				</p>
				<p>
				The technologies available online through the knowledge portal will be re-
				engineered to provide an accessible mobile application that can be delivered by province or
				to individual users to enable exchange and transfer of agricultural knowledge generated
				from research at national, regional and provincial levels. The three-pronged thrust of the
				project is envisioned to enable the wider diffusion of the program’s developed technologies

				Project 3.2 Knowledge and Capacity Building<br/>Project Leader: Decibel V. Faustino-Eslava, PhD
				</b></p>
				<p>
				This project is one of the support and extension components of the Program. The
				project serves as a holistic enterprise that binds all the projects of this research program to
				ensure that their outputs are translated into building abilities, relationships and values that
				will enable the farming communities to improve their productivity. It is tasked to conduct
				the Training Needs Assessment (TNA) with SARAI stakeholders to ensure that outputs
				from the various projects of the proposed program are translated into a meaningful
				information and tools that will meet the identified learning criteria to ensure that the
				technical capacities of stakeholders are strengthened and also to make certain that 20
				individuals and institutions are fully equipped to understand, appreciate and apply SARAI-
				related technologies.
				</p>
				<p>
				As such, SARAI Phase 2 is inclined to follow the methodologies conducted by the
				knowledge and capacity building component of the program from Phase 1 and to make
				sure that stakeholders are updated and trained with the current SARAI technologies. The
				project will also be developing training modules and IEC materials covering the additional
				crops and any new developed technologies.

				Project 3.3 Integrating Research Results, Communication Planning, and Linking Science to Policy<br/>Project Leader: Dr. Maria Victoria O. Espaldon
				</b></p>
				<p>
				Project 3.3 will work on five major tasks: 1) serve as the program’s venue and
				facilitators to integrate the program research results; 2) draft and implement a
				communication plan for the research results, and for the program team; 3) lead the
				valuation processes and activities of the program; 4) identify possible policy implications of
				the research results and technologies; and 5) serve as the program management of the
				whole program to keep the components in track with their objectives and timelines.
				</p>
				<p>
				One big task of project 3.3 is to maintain and expand Project SARAI’s network – be it
				partnerships among SUCs, government offices, or private institutions. The SARAI network
				allows the team to device strategies on how to possibly mainstream and streamline the
				program’s various outputs into the ongoing activities and protocols. The communication
				plan will also help the team design stakeholder-specific content and materials; the
				component will use the needs analysis gathered by project 3.2. The component will target
				both local level and mainstream level of promoting Project SARAI’s outputs and
				technologies.
