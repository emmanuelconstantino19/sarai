					Project SARAI (Smarter Approaches to Reinvigorate Agriculture as an Industry in the Philippines) is an action-research program working towards reducing climate risks by providing agricultural stakeholders with site-specific crop advisories. The crop advisories are targeted for rice, corn, banana, coconut, coffee, cacao, sugarcane, soybean, and tomato. The crop advisories focus on integrating local weather data and drought forecast with farm management activities, specifically nutrient and water management, and proactive pest and disease monitoring. 
					<br/><br/>
					Project SARAI also implements a near real-time monitoring of production areas using remotely-sensed images.
					Project SARAI is implemented by the University of the Philippines Los Baños (UPLB), together with 11 State Universities and Colleges (SUCs) and six National Government Agencies. It is funded by the Department of Science and Technology – Philippine Council for Agriculture, Aquatic and Natural Resources Research and Development (DOST-PCAARRD).
					<br/><br/>
					Project SARAI anchors on sustainability through multi-level partnerships starting from farming communities up to national agencies. In 2021, the ultimate goal is to have established regional and community-level SARAI hubs where farmers can easily go to for up-to-date information, and to report initial farm conditions.
