            <span style="font-size:medium">To develop protocol in disseminating agricultural drought warnings, outputs of SARAI are integrated to outputs of the Drought and Crop Assessment Forecasting project. The inputs to DCAF include soil moisture data, AWS data, hydrological data and other datasets in SEAMS and crop groups. On the other hand, agricultural drought onset and severity and seasonal forecasts, which are primary outputs of DCAF, serve as inputs to water management models, crop management and yield projection models and assessment of its possible contribution to pest infestation and crop diseases.<br/><br/>
