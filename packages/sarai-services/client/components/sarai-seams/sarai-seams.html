            <span style="font-size:medium">SEAMS is a system used for a more proactive, near real-time, and site-specific monitoring of cropping areas. Through SEAMS, farmlands monitoring is easier and more efficient. The system can deliver accurate information on pest epidemics, crop disease outbreaks, as well as crop water and nutrient requirements.<br/><br/>

SEAMS uses Geographic Information System (GIS), Remote Sensing (RS), and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for assessing and monitoring crop growth, crop health, crop loss and extent of crop damage due to typhoons, and extreme weather events such as the occurrences of El Niño and La Niña.<br/><br/>
