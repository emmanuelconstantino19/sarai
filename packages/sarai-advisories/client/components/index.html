                    <li>The current wet season corn crop as predicted will be bountiful because the rains
                        fell at max daylength. This is more pronounced in parts of the country in the
                        northern latitude like Isabela. The problem is the still high amount of rainfall at
                        harvest time this month i.e. June planted. Availability of dryers is essential in the
                        current crop.</li>
    
                    <li>The dry season crop will be a challenge because of still high amount rainfall in October but farmers in Luzon have to plant soonest in order to avoid the dry spell come January. If they plant late i.e. November, flowering might ensue come the dry episode in January. As advised earlier, farmers in Isabela might just wait for the typhoons to subside and plant soonest when conditions are more favorable. Early maturing varieties would be handy this season. Cloud seeding might be needed to help the late dry season planted crop. It would be sad if they lose it because of the usually good quality of harvest because it is harvested during the dry months (Feb-April). Very late planting i.e. January would be too risky because of expected water stress.</li>
    
                    <li>The very low amount of rainfall in January in Ilocos, Central Luzon (including Bulacan which has the Angat Dam providing water for Metro Manila which will also be dry by January) and Mindoro provinces is a big concern. The farmers might have to think of planting other less water requiring crops like legumes, vegetable and even corn that is early maturing. But if adequate irrigation moisture could be made available, then it will be alright to plant in December. January planted crop might be expensive to sustain because of expected big expense on irrigation</li>
                    <li>Bicol is much better off; its rainfall pattern even looks like Mindanao!</li>
                    <li>The rainfall pattern in Visayas and Mindanao could provide a wider planting window for corn. CARAGA will be exceptionally wet.</li>
                    <li>For the purpose of crop insurance for Luzon, November planted rainfed corn crop might be too risky. But if irrigation could be made available especially in after-rice fields, December planting might be the latest. In Visayas and Mindanao (and even Bicol in Luzon), even November planted rainfed corn crop is less risky.</li>
                    <li>To repeat, we expect good crop production this cropping year i.e. 2019 wet season and 2019-2020 dry season given the proper logistical preparation. Below is the summary per province per region and further summarized by island group. The prediction per municipality is in the Sarai website.</li>
                </ul> -->

                <p>
                        It is now basically harvest time for the wet season and planting time for the dry season. PSA’s
                        report proved true our prediction that we’ll have bountiful wet season crop: growth of 23.47%. This
                        was basically because the rains fell at max daylength particularly in Cagayan Valley.
                        The dry season crop will be a challenge in Cagayan Valley because of still high amount rainfall this
                        month. But farmers there really have to plant soonest as soon as weather permits for there will be
                        significant drop in rainfall by January. Regions II, and CAR, might have to plan for cloud seeding
                        early next year just in case lack of rain happens at flowering time. The condition is similar to
                        Regions IVA and IVB but IVB’s corn is corn-after-rice and so there is irrigation to sustain the crop.
                        Regions I and III will really be dry starting December. Bicol Region will receive adequate rain till
                        January extending up to February. Bicol could plant till December: there is till rain at flowering time
                        by January.</p>
                        <p>
                        For the Visayas regions, planting could still be done in December because there is still some rain
                        in January. Eastern Visayas will be very wet this month till February next year.
                        In Mindanao, there is good distribution of rainfall till March next year. Exception is Zamboanga
                        Region which has comparatively reduced rainfall early next year. CARAGA, as usual, will be very
                        wet till March (Note that Bicol, Eastern Visayas and CARAGA all face the Pacific Ocean).
                        In summary, Mindanao can provide good corn crop this dry season. A third (“palusot”) crop is
                        possible. Cagayan Valley has to plant early (November) and that is a challenge because it is now
                        reeling from intense rain. They could still plant late but cloud seeding preparation will probably be
                        called for. Early maturing varieties would help. With reduced daylength (autumn and winter in
                        Northern hemisphere and that is where we are but nearer to the equator) and possible moisture
                        stress, we don’t expect bumper crop but hopefully still good production from the Region. The
                        Central Plain of Luzon (I and III) and Mindoro (IVB) could supply good corn-after-rice crop. Overall,
                        the quality of dry season harvest will be good. This should translate to better price for the corn
                        farmers. <b>Hopefully, no import comes during harvest!</b></p>
                        <p>
                        This is not agriculture anymore, it but it is interesting to note that NCR will be dry early next year
                        including Bulacan where Angat is!

            <h6>Dr. Artemio Salazar, June 3, 2019</h6>
            <ul>
                <li>The current wet season covered in the May-September 2019 SEAMS rainfall prediction looks agronomically favorable to our crop production, especially for rainfed crop like corn. Planting in almost all regions commenced in May and expected to continue till June. Rainfall steadily increased up to August and declining a little bit in September. With adequate rainfall and longer daylength during this time of the year (summer in Northern Hemisphere), good harvest is expected this wet season.</li>

                <li>Total amount of predicted rainfall for the May-September (1.38m) is almost half of the average annual rainfall and that should be adequate enough for corn. Drying though the grains harvest might be crucial for this wet season. We need rain when growing the crop but not during harvest time. If harvest would be in the so called “Indian summer” in August then that would be favorable to the farmers. Beyond that, mechanical dryers are a must. Conditioning those mechanical dryers this time would be in order. Post harvest is indeed an important issue in Philippine corn industry because harvest of the major production falls in rainy period.</li>

                <li>In June, all Regions have rainfall in excess of 200 cm. This means that rice planting could start in June and extends and probably even to August. Expected harvest would be in Sept/October. As the “ber” months are notorious for stronger typhoons, late planted crop might be affected as it might come during flowering or early grain formation stage. The advise is to plant as early as possible.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Summer solstice is on June 21. Expect longer days than night up to September. Coupled with more rains, this is the reason why crop yields are higher these months. Short day plants i.e. plants requiring shorter day length to flower like sorghum, soybeans, some forages and vegetables will tend to be vegetative i.e. with more biomass formation. This will indeed be very advantageous for the northern part of the country like CAR and Cagayan Valley. But again the problem with typhoons. Hence the importance of planting time (early) in those areas to avoid the wraths of typhoon especially at harvest time and sometimes even flowering time (if planted late). This is the reason why you notice the tractors in Isabela are almost in a race at planting time during the wet season viz, to make best use of the weather. The late planters will wail. They might not know these equinoxes and solstices, but they know what they are doing!</li>

                <li>The only concern now is the price of corn at harvest. With 2 million tons of feed wheat imported, equivalent to .7M tons of corn, that will indeed be a huge corn price depressant. Let us export corn to help our farmers!</li>

                <li>Maybe this is the time to promote corn- legume rotation so that the farmers will not be beholden to one crop. We import a lot of those legumes anyway (mungbean, peanut and soybean) so there is local market. The rotation also perks up the corn yield after the legume crop because of the N-fixation capability of the legumes hence saving on N fertilizer. We have the local data to support that. It can also break the corn pest/diseases build up in the farm. Help the farmer, help the soil, help the corn: let us do crop rotation! In some countries that is even legislated.</li>

                <li>Reminder again for the conditioning of mechanical dryers. Also for crops harvestable during dry months of March and April, like cassava. Planting fruit trees and other perennials now would also be ideal. Diversifying the crops in our farms would be good for the environment and farmers’ livelihood</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Rainfall prediction augurs well for corn, and rice production. Rain will probably continue on till November in most of our farms.</li>
                <li>For corn, it is expected that there will not be much window between the wet season and dry season planting. A third season (palusot) crop, corn, and other upland crops might even be possible. It looks like the marshes in Mindanao cannot be planted.</li>
                <li>Let us hope that the current peace and order problem in Mindanao will not be that extensive as to affect the farmers' opportunity to plant. If they cannot plant, then this well have socio-economic repurcussions later.</li>
                <li>The scenario might be similar for rice but the harvest will come later as irrigation dams still have to be filled up before water distribution. With good rain coming even in the start of the dry season, more areas can be expected &mdash; irrigated and rainfed. We expect good crop harvest then this wet season and the next dry season.</li>
                <li>Reminder for our farmers to start conditioning their mechanical dryers as they might have a big need for those at harvest time</li>
                <li>It might be a good idea to plan for the usual dry months of March and April e.g. by planting cassava (10-month crop) this June harvestable by March.</li>
                <li>It looks like we’ll have a good crop harvest this year and let us make most use of the expected favorable weather.</li>

            <li>Mindanao and Eastern Visayas, rainfall beyond 100mm is already expected in later part of April or early May and it will mostly happen in CARAGA, Davao and Eastern Visayas.</li>

            <li>Corn, and other upland crops including rainfed upland rice, is therefore expected to be planted earlier in these regions. Other regions will experience more rains in June and planting will ensue. Earliest corn harvest (in July) is therefore expected from Mindanao.</li>

            <li>There will be slight drop in rainfall in June but the moistened soil in May and further rain (though less in June) should be enough to sustain the corn/upland crop</li>

            <li>Rainfall is expected to be heavy in July and August. Drying could be a concern here if corn harvesting happens in these months (wet grains have less market price). Early planting or use of early maturing varieties (of corn and other suitable crops) is therefore advisable.</li>

            <li>For lowland rice, irrigated and rainfed, soil saturation is expected to happen in July-August. Generally, there is heavier rainfall during these months for Luzon and Visayas. Mindanao has more even rainfall Expect wet season rice harvest to come in earliest by October mostly coming from Mindanao.</li>
