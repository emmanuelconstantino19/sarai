            <ul>
                <li>Rainfall prediction augurs well for corn, and rice production. Rain will probably continue on till November in most of our farms.</li>
                <li>For corn, it is expected that there will not be much window between the wet season and dry season planting. A third season (palusot) crop, corn, and other upland crops might even be possible. It looks like the marshes in Mindanao cannot be planted.</li>
                <li>Let us hope that the current peace and order problem in Mindanao will not be that extensive as to affect the farmers' opportunity to plant. If they cannot plant, then this well have socio-economic repurcussions later.</li>
                <li>The scenario might be similar for rice but the harvest will come later as irrigation dams still have to be filled up before water distribution. With good rain coming even in the start of the dry season, more areas can be expected &mdash; irrigated and rainfed. We expect good crop harvest then this wet season and the next dry season.</li>
                <li>Reminder for our farmers to start conditioning their mechanical dryers as they might have a big need for those at harvest time</li>
                <li>It might be a good idea to plan for the usual dry months of March and April e.g. by planting cassava (10-month crop) this June harvestable by March.</li>
                <li>It looks like weâ€™ll have a good crop harvest this year and let us make most use of the expected favorable weather.</li>

            <li>Mindanao and Eastern Visayas, rainfall beyond 100mm is already expected in later part of April or early May and it will mostly happen in CARAGA, Davao and Eastern Visayas.</li>

            <li>Corn, and other upland crops including rainfed upland rice, is therefore expected to be planted earlier in these regions. Other regions will experience more rains in June and planting will ensue. Earliest corn harvest (in July) is therefore expected from Mindanao.</li>

            <li>There will be slight drop in rainfall in June but the moistened soil in May and further rain (though less in June) should be enough to sustain the corn/upland crop</li>

            <li>Rainfall is expected to be heavy in July and August. Drying could be a concern here if corn harvesting happens in these months (wet grains have less market price). Early planting or use of early maturing varieties (of corn and other suitable crops) is therefore advisable.</li>

            <li>For lowland rice, irrigated and rainfed, soil saturation is expected to happen in July-August. Generally, there is heavier rainfall during these months for Luzon and Visayas. Mindanao has more even rainfall Expect wet season rice harvest to come in earliest by October mostly coming from Mindanao.</li>

            <p>Palay and corn production for January-December 2016 were lower than their 2015 levels. The first two quarters decrements in outputs were attributed to dry spell and drought and effects of typhoons Lando and Nona which hit the Philippines in the last quarter of 2015. The last two quarters decrements, on the other hand, were due to the movement of harvest of harvest to the third quarter 2016 and first quarter 2017 and effects of typhoons Karen and Lawin in Luzon regions.</p>
